# README

This is my README for the FreeDoc DB app on rails for today's THP PROJECT, there will be a seed.db to test the db is working correctly it should have 3 models appointments doctors and patients. This runs on ruby 3.0.0 dont forget bundle install, no other specific requirements ? run rails console (--sandbox to not save your modifications) and $ Rails.application.load_seed . use tp anytable.all to visualize the newly generated table.
